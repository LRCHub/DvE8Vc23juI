[00:14.98] Here comes the rain
[00:21.99] So many scars never fade
[00:28.40] This is the price of war
[00:35.43] And we've paid with time
[00:42.56] We'll fight fight 'til there's nothing left to say (Whatever it takes)
[00:49.46] We'll fight fight 'til your fears, they go away
[00:56.79] The light is gone and we know once more
[01:03.82] We'll fight fight 'til we see another day
[01:24.32] 
[01:18.98] Let's move along, it's late
[01:26.08] The sun will rise once again
[01:32.26] This field is lined with the brave
[01:39.43] Souls in relief
[01:46.93] 
[01:46.53] We'll fight fight 'til there's nothing left to say (Whatever it takes)
[01:53.64] Fight fight 'til your fears they go away
[02:00.67] The light is gone and we know once more
[02:07.75] We'll fight fight 'til we see another day
[02:14.49] Another day
[02:19.99] 
[02:21.19] Whatever it takes
[02:28.23] Whatever it takes
[02:36.73] 
[02:36.36] Oh, oh-oh
[02:40.86] 
[02:52.50] Here comes the rain
[02:59.27] So many scars never fade
[03:05.88] This is the price of war
[03:12.61] And we've paid with time
[03:19.77] We'll fight fight 'til there's nothing left to say (Whatever it takes)
[03:26.90] Fight fight 'til your fears, they go away
[03:34.15] The light is gone and we know once more
[03:40.94] We'll fight fight 'til we see another day
[03:48.05] We'll fight fight 'til we see another day
[03:55.57] We'll fight fight 'til we see another day
